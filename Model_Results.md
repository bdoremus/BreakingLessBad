# Predict the weekly failure rate
Predictions represent the percentage of the total number of compressors that fail that week.  
There are 300 days of complete data for all 6 asset regions.

| Group size | number of entries |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Week: 7 days | 252 |
| Half week: 3 days | 600 |
| 1 day | 1800 |

**There are only 252 rows to predict on:** 42 weeks with 6 business units

If I take each day and make one entry per compressor (which the data doesn't permit), then there will likely be ample data.

### Gaussian Process Regressor
Data is sanitized and scaled prior to being fit by the GPR model.
```python
kernel = RationalQuadratic() + 0.1 * WhiteKernel()

model = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel, n_restarts_optimizer=5)
```
Rational Quadratic kernels are:
```
 "...a scale mixture of squared exponential kernels with different length scales.
 This gives variations with a range of time-scales, the distribution peaking around
Î» but extending to significantly longer period (but remaining rather smooth)"  
(http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/Pubs/philTransA_2012.pdf)

# What I *Should* be doing
Create this model in PyMC3.  This will allow for multilevel modeling (the model can change slightly for each business unit) and interpretability of features.
